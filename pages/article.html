        <p><em>This edition of PRPL Spotlight shineth down on Alex King, our unicorn-loving, keyword-crafting starlet. She’s got good taste in music, food, and Tina Fey books, so hear her out for your own good.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Alex King<br>
            <strong>Hometown:</strong> Lutz, FL (It’s right outside of Tampa. We have our own country song!)<br>
            <strong>Spotify Playlist:</strong> <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/127525627/playlist/3dBMM8YPTgong5nAmjIDkd" target="_blank">Tune out and tune in.</a><br>
            <strong>PRPL Start Date:</strong> October 29th, 2012. I was the last hire in the old office and I replaced the foosball table. I was not very popular that week.

        <h2>What do you do here?</h2>
        <p>I’m an Associate Marketing Strategist, which could mean a great many of things. For me, it means I’m the resident SEO expert and User Experience Architect in training.</p>
        <h2>What was the inspiration for your playlist?</h2>
        <p>This is the playlist I listen to when I’m heads-down trying to fine tune the last few details on something I’m working on. It’s loud enough that I can’t hear anyone or anything with my headphones in.</p>
        <h2>Worst pickup line used on you? That you’ve used?</h2>
        <p>When I was an RA, I had a floor full of football players and they were fairly creative. I think my favorite was “Hey girl, we’re making pizza and cookies.” My pickup is less of a line and more of a collection of terrible dance moves, much like <a href="http://youtu.be/ZX-n1VeASW4?t=30s" target="_blank">this video</a> at about :30.</p>
        <h2>Backstreet Boys or ‘N Sync?</h2>
        <p>Backstreet’s back, alright!</p>
        <h2>If you could sanction one law at PRPL, what would it be?</h2>
        <p>We’d install nitro and a stout faucet on the kegerator so we could have dark beers on tap. Milk stouts, porters, and imperial stouts, oh my!</p>
        <h2>Most exciting celebrity sighting?</h2>
        <p>I was in an elevator with Jackie Chan once in Vegas. He said “Hi.” My dad swooned.</p>
        <h2>Tell us about the last book you read.</h2>
        <p><em>Bossypants</em> by Tina Fey. There’s an entire chapter on how she feels about pants—that I completely agree with (hint: no one should wear them at home). She also does a great job talking about her experience and opinions about being a woman in the workplace and a working mother. She’s funny AND empowering. Go read it.</p>
        <h2>Coffee or tea?</h2>
        <p>If it’s a weekday, tea. If it’s a weekend, I’ll have a cortadito with the seasonal syrup from Downtown Credo, please!</p>
        <h2>What’s your favorite Internet meme?</h2>
        <p><a href="http://calmingmanatee.com/" target="_blank">Calming manatee</a>. I frequently find myself on the Tumblr in need of some wise manatee sage advice.</p>
        <h2>You have one meal to eat for the rest of your life. It is…</h2>
        <p>A ninja roll, a zombie roll, and a white Russian roll from Sushi Lola’s. Yes, I realize that’s enough sushi for three people, but only because they always give me three cookies when I order it for takeout on Friday nights.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Thanks, Alex, and enjoy your scary-sounding sushi tonight. We hope one of your cookies bequeaths good fortune.</em>
